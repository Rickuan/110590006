            <h2 id="Intro">Introduction to the History of Area <s>69</s> 51</h2>
            <p>
                The origin of the name "Area 51" is unclear.
                It is believed to be from an Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) numbering grid, although Area 51 is not part of this system; it is adjacent to Area 15.
                Another explanation is that 51 was used because it was unlikely that the AEC would use the number.
                According to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the correct names for the facility are Homey Airport (XTA/KXTA) and Groom Lake, though the name "Area 51" was used in a CIA document from the Vietnam War.
                The facility has also been referred to as "Dreamland" and "Paradise Ranch", among other nicknames, with the former also being the approach control call sign for the surrounding area.
                The USAF public relations has referred to the facility as "an operating location near Groom Dry Lake".
                The special use airspace around the field is referred to as Restricted Area 4808 North (R-4808N).
                Lead and silver were discovered in the southern part of the Groom Range in 1864, and the English company Groome Lead Mines Limited financed the Conception Mines in the 1870s, giving the district its name (nearby mines included Maria, Willow, and White Lake).
                J. B. Osborne and partners acquired the controlling interest in Groom in 1876, and Osbourne's son acquired it in the 1890s.
                Mining continued until 1918, then resumed after World War II until the early 1950s.
                The airfield on the Groom Lake site began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field and consisted of two unpaved 5,000-foot (1,524 m) runways.
